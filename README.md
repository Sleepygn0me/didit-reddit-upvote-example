## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - the URL of your Postgres database (eg. the Supabase connection string)
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - the Next Auth secret string (this can be anything at all like a password, but keep it secret!)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - the GitHub OAuth client ID (create yours in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - the GitHub OAuth client secret (create this in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site

## Reflection

For this project I met the requirement of deploying to vercel, I had some initial challanges during this assignment how ever the initial attempt to run the app in local host and the first attempt to deploy helped to point me in the right direction as to where the main issue was which was in the UserInfo.jsx.
this presented me with an error of cannot read properties undefined. after looking into potential fixes for this issue I was lead to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator as a possible fix as with out the ternary operator the session was returning null which was causing the issues once I had implemented this change and setup the database the site seemed to deploy successfully.

I then wanted to ensure the log in worked as when I attempted to log in on the deployed site I was met with an error that directed me to look at the logs in vercel as I didnt quite understand what the errors where I asked chatgpt to explain what the error was with out giving me any code.

after the explanation I was able to find the error which was that the env.local and the enviroment variables on vercel where missing the NEXTAUTH_URL and the AUTH_SECRET needed to be NEXTAUTH_SECRET once I had added the nextauth url and changed the AUTH_SECRET the sign in now works.
